# llist
Two-way linked list implementation, that holds generic data (void *), put anything you like into it. I created it just for the pure joy of learning C, it is not complete, and I do not expext that anybody can make any use of it other than self-study data structures :-) The source structure is made by `newc`, the C project building tool, that generates new project, files and make files with tests.

## Dependencies
Newc uses Criterion framework for tests. If you want to use tests, install Criterion (https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion.git).

## Installation
Just clone this repo via `git clone https://github.com/bobac/llist.git`.

## Building
Type `make`. It will pickup the files and compile everything. `make clean` will delete the binaries.


## Testing
If you want to tun tests, just run `make test`.
